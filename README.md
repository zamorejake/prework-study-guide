# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a new boot camp student the amount of information we are going to have to learn will be massive and I want to be able to maintain that information to use in a professional setting. I wanted to create a website where it would be easy to organize that information and keep track of what I learned and what comes next. This website solves the problem of information overload by easily sorting topics into categories and allowing for bullet points to briefly jot down notes. I learned a lot on this project, basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Not to mention practicing version control with Git and Github along the way which made the whole process much easier and set the foundation for future collaboration with coders.

## Usage

To use this website you can read the notes in each section to get some fun facts about assorted topics. For recommendations on what to study open the Chrome DevTools by hitting F12 on the keyboard and clicking on the console (or using a shortcut dependent on the OS) and a randomly chosen topic from the prework will appear to study more.
